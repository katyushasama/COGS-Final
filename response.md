This project is about tic-tac-toe game. I use minimax algorithm to make the AI always make the best move. Minimax is a DFS algorithm, which it will run all the possible moves, and based on the check-win function to return the score of each move and the Minimax function always return the move with highest score. The function run recursively, it is using for loop to check the spot is available or not and if the spot is available, it will go to the next recursive level and keep trying all the possible until the check-win function give a “win”, “lose”, or “Tie”. The draw function is for draw the current grid. Check move function is the highest (or lowest) level of the recursion, it do the first steps for the DFS_minimax function (AI move). And then DFS_minimax function will be predicted next human moves and the next AI moves which can return the best score to the Check_move function so that Check_move function can decide where to go. play function is just a while True loop and in this loop, the program always ask for the user input and call the check win function to check is there a winner. Main function just to print the output and the loop is for player play more than one round.
